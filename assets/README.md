Add item photos and assets here. Recommendation:
- Create folder public/assets/items/
- Name files by item id, e.g. pal.jpg, idli.jpg
- In the React app you can show images by referencing `/assets/items/${id}.jpg`


You can crop the provided menu image into individual item photos using any image editor. Keep images around 400x300 px for fast loading.
